MNIST Handwritten digit classification

Using the MNIST dataset, handwritten digit recognition is a significant effort that
was created with the use of neural networks. In essence, it recognizes the scanned
copies of handwritten numbers.
Our handwritten digit recognition technology goes a step further by allowing users
to write their own numbers on the screen using an integrated GUI for recognition
in addition to detecting handwritten digits in scanned photos.
The brightness of each pixel on a greyscale of CNN's 28x28 grid, which has 784
pixels, represents the neuron's "activation," with 0 being black and 1 denoting
white.

The initial layer of the neural network is made up of each of these 784 neurons.
Ten neurons representing one digit each make up the last layer. Based on which
neuron in the network has the highest level of activation, the final layer identifies
which digit a picture represents.
The goal is for the neural network to move from pixels to edges, edges to
patterns, and patterns to digits.
